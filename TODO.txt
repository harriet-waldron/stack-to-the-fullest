make stories, add, delete, update and changes stick when logged in 
make login and register portals (will auth work when deployed?)
have add story show when logged in
flesh out database with actual information
add section on creation myths, maramataka, navigation, user stories, contact info, resources page (SMART etc)
style, find images etc


Change function names etc to be more descriptive - it is pretty confusing right now
 -- add comments everywhere I do this so I have a trail to follow in case I break everything
 --add input to param names
 then figure out where all my params are coming from
